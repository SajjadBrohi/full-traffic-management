# full-traffic-management

## Details

A simple simulation of a traffic management system (TMS). A traffic management system monitors traffic flow in a region and adjusts traffic signals to optimise traffic flow. A TMS uses different types of sensors and signals to monitor and manage traffic flow. 

This is a two-part assignment project for the Programming in Large (CSSE7023) course at the University of Queensland (UQ). In the first assignment I implemented the core model for the TMS. In the second assignment I implemented the more advanced logic to provide a very simple simulation for the TMS.

## How to use

The TMS application is initialised and started by the Launcher class in the tms package

## Uses

1. JavaFX (GUI)

2. JUnit (Testing)

3. SVN (Version Control)
